// ðŸš€ # What is process in java;
// In Java, a Process represents an operating system process.
// It allows you to execute commands or run external programs from within your Java application. 

// ðŸš€ # What is Runtime
// Runtime is a class that represents the current runtime environment of the application. 
// It provides access to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and allows you to interact
//  with the underlying system.

// ðŸš€ #getRuntime():
// This is a static method of the Runtime class. It returns the runtime object associated with the current
//  Java application.

// ðŸš€ #exec(String command):
// This method is used to execute the specified command in a separate operating system process. It returns a Process object that represents the newly created process.
